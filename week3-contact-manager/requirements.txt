This Contact Management System is developed using only Python standard libraries, which are included by default with Python installations. Therefore, no additional third-party packages are required.

Libraries used (Standard Library):

The project uses the following built-in Python modules:
json – for storing and retrieving contact data in JSON format
re – for validating phone numbers and email addresses
datetime – for recording contact creation and update timestamps
os – for checking file existence and file handling

Since these modules come pre-installed with Python, they do not need to be listed as dependencies.
